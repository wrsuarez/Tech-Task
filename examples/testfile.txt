Theres so much Oracle all over the place I don’t know what to do with myself! I see Oracle over here, Oracle over there. I see Oracle everywhere.


I don’t necessarily use Oracle much but if you use Oracle you should seriously consider having documentation for it. It can be complicated

We’ve also seen some Microsoft over here and there’s some SAP over there. The Unicode special character was a bit interesting.


And I really like what Microsoft is doing with .Net code
